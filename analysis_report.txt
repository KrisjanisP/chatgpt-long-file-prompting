# Comprehensive Report: Analysis of 'testlib.h'

This comprehensive report compiles the analysis of the 'exitcodes' section in 'testlib.h' from the individual chunks.

## Analysis of the 'exitcodes' Section in 'testlib.h'

The 'exitcodes' section in 'testlib.h' is a critical component of the testlib library. It defines various exit codes used for handling different outcomes of test executions. These exit codes are defined using preprocessor directives (`#define`), which allows for customization based on different conditions or environments.

### Defined Exit Codes

The following exit codes are defined in the 'exitcodes' section:

1. **OK_EXIT_CODE**: Represents a successful execution of a test. The default is `0`, but it can vary based on the environment (e.g., `0xAC` for CONTESTER).
2. **WA_EXIT_CODE**: Indicates a wrong answer. The default is `1`, with variations for specific environments (e.g., `5` for EJUDGE).
3. **PE_EXIT_CODE**: Stands for presentation error. Defaults to `2`, with variations for EJUDGE and CONTESTER.
4. **FAIL_EXIT_CODE**: Indicates a failure in the test. Default is `3`, with environment-specific values (e.g., `6` for EJUDGE).
5. **DIRT_EXIT_CODE**: Represents a dirty output, defaulting to `4` but can be `6` for EJUDGE.
6. **POINTS_EXIT_CODE**: Used to return a score from a scoring system, defaulting to `7`.
7. **UNEXPECTED_EOF_EXIT_CODE**: Indicates an unexpected end of file condition, defaulting to `8`.
8. **PC_BASE_EXIT_CODE**: Used for partially correct outputs, defaulting to `0` but can be `50` if TESTSYS is defined.

### Functions and Comments

The comments preceding the exit code definitions explain the purpose of each exit code and the conditions under which they are used. These definitions allow for easy customization and adaptability of the library to different judging systems or environments by simply changing the values based on defined macros.

## Summary

The 'exitcodes' section of 'testlib.h' plays a vital role in managing the outcomes of tests run using the testlib framework. It provides a clear and customizable way to handle success and various failure scenarios, allowing developers to adapt the library to their specific needs and environments. This adaptability ensures the library's wide applicability across different judging systems and environments.
