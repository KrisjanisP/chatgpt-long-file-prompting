# Comprehensive Report on Exit Codes in "testlib.h"

## Introduction
This report provides a detailed analysis of the exit codes defined in the "testlib.h" header file. The purpose of this analysis is to clarify the significance, usage, and implications of these exit codes, particularly in the context of competitive programming and automated judging systems.

## 1. Identification of Exit Code Section
The exit codes are defined in the middle section of the "testlib.h" file through a series of `#define` directives. The following exit codes are defined:

```cpp
#ifndef OK_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef CONTESTER
#       define OK_EXIT_CODE 0xAC
#   else
#       define OK_EXIT_CODE 0
#   endif
#endif

#ifndef WA_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef EJUDGE
#       define WA_EXIT_CODE 5
#   elif defined(CONTESTER)
#       define WA_EXIT_CODE 0xAB
#   else
#       define WA_EXIT_CODE 1
#   endif
#endif

#ifndef PE_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef EJUDGE
#       define PE_EXIT_CODE 4
#   elif defined(CONTESTER)
#       define PE_EXIT_CODE 0xAA
#   else
#       define PE_EXIT_CODE 2
#   endif
#endif

#ifndef FAIL_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef EJUDGE
#       define FAIL_EXIT_CODE 6
#   elif defined(CONTESTER)
#       define FAIL_EXIT_CODE 0xA3
#   else
#       define FAIL_EXIT_CODE 3
#   endif
#endif

#ifndef DIRT_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef EJUDGE
#       define DIRT_EXIT_CODE 6
#   else
#       define DIRT_EXIT_CODE 4
#   endif
#endif

#ifndef POINTS_EXIT_CODE
#   define POINTS_EXIT_CODE 7
#endif

#ifndef UNEXPECTED_EOF_EXIT_CODE
#   define UNEXPECTED_EOF_EXIT_CODE 8
#endif

#ifndef PC_BASE_EXIT_CODE
#   ifdef TESTSYS
#       define PC_BASE_EXIT_CODE 50
#   else
#       define PC_BASE_EXIT_CODE 0
#   endif
#endif
```

## 2. Summary of Exit Codes
The following table summarizes the purpose and assigned values of each exit code:

| Exit Code                     | Purpose                                   | Value(s)                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **OK_EXIT_CODE**              | Indicates successful execution            | 0xAC (CONTESTER), 0 (otherwise)           |
| **WA_EXIT_CODE**              | Represents a "wrong answer" verdict      | 5 (EJUDGE), 0xAB (CONTESTER), 1 (otherwise) |
| **PE_EXIT_CODE**              | Stands for "presentation error"          | 4 (EJUDGE), 0xAA (CONTESTER), 2 (otherwise) |
| **FAIL_EXIT_CODE**            | Indicates a failure in execution          | 6 (EJUDGE), 0xA3 (CONTESTER), 3 (otherwise) |
| **DIRT_EXIT_CODE**            | Represents a "dirt" error                | 6 (EJUDGE), 4 (otherwise)                  |
| **POINTS_EXIT_CODE**          | Used for scoring                          | 7                                          |
| **UNEXPECTED_EOF_EXIT_CODE**  | Indicates an unexpected end of file      | 8                                          |
| **PC_BASE_EXIT_CODE**         | Used in point-based systems               | 50 (TESTSYS), 0 (otherwise)                |

## 3. Significance of Exit Codes
The exit codes serve as a standardized method for communicating the outcomes of program executions. This is particularly vital in competitive programming, where automated judging systems (like EJUDGE and CONTESTER) depend on specific exit codes to assess the status of submissions. The differentiation of exit codes based on compilation flags allows for adaptable behavior depending on the environment and intended use case.

## 4. Dependencies and Related Functions
The exit codes are utilized in various functions throughout the library that manage program execution, input/output operations, and error reporting. Key functions that leverage these exit codes include:
- `quit()`
- `quitf()`
- `quits()`

Additionally, the `validator` and `checker` classes rely on these exit codes to determine the outcomes of validation and checking processes.

## 5. Potential Issues and Considerations
- **Portability**: The variability of exit codes based on compilation flags may lead to confusion if the library is used in different contexts without a clear understanding of these dependencies.
- **Error Handling**: Developers using this library should ensure they handle each exit code appropriately to provide clear feedback in their applications.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the exit codes is essential to ensure that users of the library understand their meanings and implications.

## Conclusion
The exit codes defined in "testlib.h" are integral to the library's functionality, providing a standardized way to report the results of program executions. Understanding these codes and their context is essential for developers utilizing the library in competitive programming or automated judging systems. Proper handling and documentation of these exit codes will enhance the usability and reliability of the library in various programming environments.
